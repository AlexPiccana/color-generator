# color-generator

hi welcome to my first project =)

# what is this

its my first project and im learning git and js

it basically generates five colours from a list. you can use space to regenerate and lock individual colours. you can also click the colour to copy the code in either hex or rgb format, changeable at the top.

# can i help?

sure you can leave any comments if you think i could have done something more efficently or better, that would be great! :3

# can i download this?

sure! its a very basic wip so don't expect anything magical but feel free to mess around with it yourself!
